    <h1>Ending?</h1>
  
  </body>
  
  <p>After hiking for several hours you decided to head back home knowing you made the right choices today.</p>
  <i>The End!</i>

<p>Behind the scene and stuff</p>
  
  <p>This is a list for one of my ideas of making this project</p>
  <li>One of the things that did go well was the coding and the storyline for this project</li>
  <li>The Scenario's being part of the story was diffcult for me to come up so I didn't think of anything that was too extreme or fun</li>
  <li>I did 12 instead of 8 since the story wasn't finised but I didn't want to make it long or short so I fixed some of the coding which was okay in the end</li>
  <li>I needed an topic that was easy to do,but very realistic</li>
